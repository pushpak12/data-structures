In this section, I have solved some easy array problems. I have listed all the problems and their solution approach in short.

1. Largest Element in the Array
	Problem statement : 
	Given an array ‘arr’ of size ‘n’ find the largest element in the array.
	Example:
	Input: 'n' = 5, 'arr' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	Output: 5
	Solution : 
	Simply iterate over the given array 'arr' using for loop. declare largest variable and assign arr[0] value to 	it and start iterating from 1st index, then check for larger element than the largest variable value and 	assign that new value to 'largest' in this way, I will get the largest element from the array.
